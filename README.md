# Machine Learning - study guide
This repo is going to contain a set of online courses according to planned order of completion 
and also likely some notes, solved tasks, etc. This is to help me in my efforts to learn about 
data science, machine learning and things like that.

The main goal is to get to a level where I can confidently and independently implement ML solutions for 
various problems, mainly with NNs and its variants.

## Additional research/courses needed
* conversation ux
* neuro linguistic programming
* chat as an interface
* chatbots for messenger, viber, etc.
* natural language processing

# Main roadmap
This list was compiled mainly from the coursera learning path for data scientist.
